# Bootcamp-ETL-Project
The code in this repo is an analysis of restaurant data. ETL, Extract, Transform, and Load, is applied to the data in order to clean it and better form conclusions from the data. We set out with various questions, which were answered using SQL queries. The data extraction and transformation was accomplished using Jupyter Notebook and Pandas.
